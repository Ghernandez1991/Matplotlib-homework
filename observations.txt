1- Urban domination
The data clearly shows that the vast majority of the revenue and activity is generated by urban activity.
Urban drivers make up 81% of drivers, 68% of total rides and 63 % of total fares. This is perhaps to be expected given population 
density and that uber has dominated the designated driver segment of the rideshare/taxi market. With higher population, one would
generally expect higher denisty of bars, restaurants and nightclubs.  


2-average fares
The average fare based on city type is perhaps to be expected. The average urban fare is less than the rural fare. 
There is a negative relationship between number of rides per city and average fare. As a general rule, as a city has more fares
the average fare goes down. This is perhaps due to longer distances when considering rural areas, and shorted distances for more urban areas. 
Focusing on urban rides would be a volume based business decision while focusing on rural rides would appear to have greater profit potential. 
 

3- drivers.
While urban drivers clearly make up the majority of total drivers, there may be a shortage of rural drivers. 
While only 2.6% of total drivers are rural , 5.3% of total rides are rural  and 6.8% of total fares 
This appears to support that there is more demand for rural drivers than there drivers willing to meet it. I suspect that suburban drivers are crossing over between
surban/rural to meet that excess demand.  As with previous observations, rural fares are several times larger than rural drivers. Rural drivers have higher fares on average then suburban and urban drivers.
